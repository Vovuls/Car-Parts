# Car-Parts
Database in PostgreSQL for connecting parts to car. This program has a connection to database, where you can save all data from the tables.  
To clone and run this program you neeed to change login and password to the database in code. This current state needs an improvement.  
I am working on it. Additionally, images of cars aren't added to database yet.  
Below a screenshot showing how it looks like
